Nerdcubed.net - Cutter
=========================

This Project is a Simple prototype to test the functionality of the Cook, Serve, Delicious controls in Javascript

This is an unofficial fan project. Solely to parody the typical life of a YouTuber like Dan
This Project is created in my free time and out of fun and passion.
The game requires Javascript to run, and you are looking at the readme, 
so you are doing it wrong, if you just want to play, go to www.nerdcubed.net

Thank you for Playing!

Feel free to make your own adaptation of the game and please share the results.
